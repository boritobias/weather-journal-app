# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## To get started

- clone project with `https://github.com/susumoa/mobile-flashcards.git`
- install Node.js
- install express, body-parser and cors with `npm install express body-parser cors`
- start the server with `node server.js`

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras

If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
